# Custom Visualizations with d3js

## Running the program

To run the program you need to start a simple webserver inside the root folder where the *README.md* is placed in.  

For example:

```cmd
npx http-server -c 1
```

After starting the webserver you can access the HTML files of the different tasks under the following URL:

```cmd
http://localhost:8080/
```

e.g. to open the solution for tasks a:

```cmd
http://localhost:8080/a/Aufgabe11_AdrianKroeger.html
```
